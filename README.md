# simpleDialogUsingForms
- This project is made to prompt the user to enter information about a specimen and then save the user inputs into a JSON file.
- The main layout of the application looks as follows:

- Upon the user selection of the layout field, the picture on the right changes to the desired orientation like the following picture. The parameter 1 and 2 text also change:

- Please note the picure is static for now but it can be made dynamic by implementing OpenGL components into the program.
- If one or more of the fiels is empty, the user will get a warning about it upon pressing save:

- If all the fields are full, then the input will be saved to a Json file in the same folder and the user will get a prompt indicating this.
- The prompt goes away after 4 seconds which allows for other entries.

- I have used a css stylesheet to set styles to the widget as desired
